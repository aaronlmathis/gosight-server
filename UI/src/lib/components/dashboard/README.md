🏗️ What I Built: Complete Drag-and-Drop Dashboard System
📊 Main Components Overview
CustomizableDashboard - The main dashboard container
DashboardGrid - Handles drag/drop and widget positioning
WidgetPicker - Widget library for adding new widgets
DashboardManager - Create/manage multiple dashboards
Individual Widget Components - 12+ different widget types
Data Service - Handles live data and API integration
💾 Where Custom Dashboards Are Saved
Dashboards are saved in 3 places with a fallback hierarchy:

1. Backend API (Primary Storage)
2. Browser localStorage (Backup/Cache)
3. In-Memory Store (Runtime)
   How it works:

When you save a dashboard → API call → localStorage backup → store update
When you load → Try API first → Fall back to localStorage → Default if neither
🧩 Widget Types: Pre-built vs Custom
Pre-built Widgets (12 types ready to use):
📈 Metric Cards - Single number displays (CPU %, memory, etc.)
📊 Charts - Line, bar, donut charts with time series data
🚨 Alert Lists - Live alert feed with filtering
📝 Event Lists - System events and logs
🖥️ System Overview - CPU, memory, disk in one widget
🔗 Quick Links - Custom bookmarks/shortcuts
📊 Endpoint Count - How many servers online/offline
⚠️ Alert Count - Alert statistics by severity
📊 Chart Widgets - Time-series data visualization
🔍 Log Stream - Live log tailing
💽 Container Stats - Docker container metrics
🌐 Network Stats - Network usage graphs
Custom Widget Creation:
YES - You can create custom widgets! Here's how:

Method 1: Add New Widget Type
Method 2: Configure Existing Widgets
📡 Data Sources: Live vs Queries
The system supports BOTH live data AND custom queries:

🔴 Live Data (Real-time)
What gets live data:

System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
Alert counts and status changes
Container statistics
Network usage
Log streams
🔍 Custom Queries (API-based)
Examples of custom queries:

Database query results
Custom business metrics
Third-party API data
Aggregated reports
Historical trends
