# Complete Drag-and-Drop Dashboard System

## Main Components Overview

- CustomizableDashboard - The main dashboard container
- DashboardGrid - Handles drag/drop and widget positioning
- WidgetPicker - Widget library for adding new widgets
- DashboardManager - Create/manage multiple dashboards
- Individual Widget Components - 12+ different widget types
- Data Service - Handles live data and API integration

## Where Custom Dashboards Are Saved

Dashboards are saved in 3 places with a fallback hierarchy:

1. Backend API (Primary Storage)
2. Browser localStorage (Backup/Cache)
3. In-Memory Store (Runtime)

## How it works:

- When you save a dashboard → API call → localStorage backup → store update
- When you load → Try API first → Fall back to localStorage → Default if neither

## Widget Types: Pre-built vs Custom

Pre-built Widgets (12 types ready to use):

- Metric Cards - Single number displays (CPU %, memory, etc.)
- Charts - Line, bar, donut charts with time series data
- Alert Lists - Live alert feed with filtering
- Event Lists - System events and logs
- System Overview - CPU, memory, disk in one widget
- Quick Links - Custom bookmarks/shortcuts
- Endpoint Count - How many servers online/offline
- Alert Count - Alert statistics by severity
- Chart Widgets - Time-series data visualization
- Log Stream - Live log tailing
- Container Stats - Docker container metrics
- Network Stats - Network usage graphs

## Custom Widget Creation:

YES - You can create custom widgets! Here's how:

- Method 1: Add New Widget Type
- Method 2: Configure Existing Widgets

## Data Sources: Live vs Queries

The system supports BOTH live data AND custom queries:

- Live Data (Real-time)

What gets live data:

- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Alert counts and status changes
- Container statistics
- Network usage
- Log streams

## Custom Queries (API-based)

Examples of custom queries:

- Database query results
- Custom business metrics
- Third-party API data
- Aggregated reports
- Historical trends
