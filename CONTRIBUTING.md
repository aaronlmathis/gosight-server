# Contributing to GoSight

Welcome to GoSight — a secure, modern observability platform for cloud-native systems. Whether you're a backend engineer, frontend designer, or DevOps wizard, we're excited to collaborate with you.

---

## Project Overview

GoSight is a modular observability tool written in Go. It includes:

- **Agent**: Collects metrics/logs (Go, gRPC, systemd, gopsutil)
- **Server**: Handles secure metric, log ingestion, stores data in VictoriaMetrics, json, pgsql
- **UI**: Admin dashboard (Tailwind, Flowbite, Chart.js, Go templates)
- **Auth**: Local login + SSO + MFA + RBAC

---

## 🛠️ Quickstart

```bash
cd dev
./setup_dev_env.sh
# or
make
```

This will:
- Clone the repo
- Start PostgreSQL + VictoriaMetrics in containers
- Load the schema and generate certs
- Build agent/server with configs in `./configs`

Credentials:
- **Postgres**: `gosight` / `devpassword`
- **Default User**: `dev` / `password`

Edit configs here:
- `configs/agent.yaml`
- `configs/server.yaml`

## Tips for Testing

```bash
# Run agent
GOSIGHT_AGENT_CONFIG=./configs/agent.yaml ./agent/gosight-agent

# Run server
GOSIGHT_SERVER_CONFIG=./configs/server.yaml ./server/gosight

# Query VictoriaMetrics
curl 'http://localhost:8428/api/v1/series?match[]=container.cpu.usage'
```
